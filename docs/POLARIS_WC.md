# Polaris Web Components

Polaris WC seems to work well alongside Polaris React, and it's a great idea to start incrementally adopting Web Components in your projects.

1. Uncomment the `<script ...></script>` in `/client/index.html`
2. Uncomment the `lib` and `include` lines from `/client/jsconfig.json`
3. If you're using VSCode or Cursor, Press `Command/Control` + `Shift` + `P` to open command palette and select `Developer: Reload Windows`.
   - If this doesn't work, restart your IDE for changes to take effect.

This enables Polaris Web Components in your project with full IntelliSense/Autocomplete support. Note that as of 5 July, 2025, Intellisense support is in beta and could be a little behind / incomplete.
